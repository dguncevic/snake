# snake
Simple snake game created in Java

In this simple Java application we are creating a snake game from scratch.
We are creating a "snake" of rectangles. Every time you eat a red circle snake get's one more rectangle on it.
In method move we are checking which input a player has put in. If it's a W button, the snake will go up, etc.
Every time our snake hits the border of the screen the game will stop telling us it's game over.
We can reset the game by clicking on N button and the snake will reappear somewhere on the screen.
